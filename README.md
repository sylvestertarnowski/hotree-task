## Technologies

1. React + TypeScript
    - chose React because I'm very comfortable with it, it allows me to create modular app, and manage state easily for form submission,
    - TypeScript for type checking to smooth out development, and avovid silly bugs,
2. CSS Grid & Flexbox
    - since CSS frameworks are out, these two will do just as fine of a job to layout everything

## How to run

1. Use npm start to run the test mode (after rebuilding dependancies with npm install),
2. Use the build files, located in ./build/ directory,
