## How to run

1. Use npm start to run the React app (obviously after rebuilding dependancies :] ),
2. Use the build files, located in ./build/ directory,

## Technologies

1. React + TypeScript
    - chose React because I'm very comfortable with it, it allows me to create modular app, and manage state easily for form submission,
    - TypeScript for type checking to smooth out development, and to avovid silly bugs,
2. CSS Grid & Flexbox, Responsiveness
    - since CSS frameworks are out, Grid and Flexbox will be just perfect
    - I tried to make everything as responsive as possible; at 600px the form starts stacking  to display everything better. On mobile devices it stacks by default.
3. Cypress for testing
    - to automate testing form submission scenarios, I've writted a few Cypress tests,
    - just in case, some instructions how to run tests, in console:
        $ npx cypress open
    - in case of troubles visit:
